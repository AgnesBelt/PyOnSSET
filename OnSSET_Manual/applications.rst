The `online interface Universal Electrification Access <https://un-desa-modelling.github.io/electrification-paths-visualisation/>`_ is part of the modelling tools for sustainable development and is based on OnSSET. This interface is not a model but it provides the user easy access to the methodology behind OnSSET, the datasets used and key results -with regards to electrification planning - obtained for a set of predefined scenarios and model runs for developing countries in SSA and Latin America.
