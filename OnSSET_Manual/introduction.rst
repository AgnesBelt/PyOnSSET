OnSSET introduction
=================================

What is OnSSET?
****************

KTH-dESA researchers are developing an innovative Open Source Spatial Electrification Toolkit (OnSSET). OnSSET is a bottom up optimization energy modelling tool, that estimates, analyzes and visualizes the most cost effective electrification option (grid, mini grid & stand-alone) for the achievement of electricity access goals. To do so, OnSSET takes into account spatially explicit characteristics related to energy. Such data include population density and distribution, proximity to transmission and road network, nighttime lights, local renewable energy potential etc.​

Objective
**********
OnSSET focuses on the assessment and deployment of conventional and renewable energy technologies aiming at ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. It is a complementary approach to existing energy planning models which do not consider geographical characteristics related to energy and aims to provide invaluable support to policy and decision makers on least-cost electrification strategies.

The tool was initially applied to Nigeria, Ethiopia and India, featuring in the World Energy Outlook 2014 and 2015 and the Global Tracking Framework 2015. OnSSET has recently been applied to 44 Sub-Saharan African countries and 10 Latin American countries. This effort forms the basis of United Nations suite of tools to promote capacity development for achieving aspects of `Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) <http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/energy/>`_, such as access to affordable supplies of modern sustainable energy for all.
