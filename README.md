# ONSSET

![onsset logo](/resources/ONSSET LOGO.png)

KTH-dESA researchers are developing an innovative Open Source Spatial Electrification Toolkit. ONSSET is an open source, spatial electrification tool estimating, analyzing and visualizing the most cost effective electrification option (grid, mini grid & stand-alone) for the achievement of electricity access goals. The tool focuses on the assessment and deployment of conventional and renewable energy technologies aiming at ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all (SDG 7). ONSSET is a complementary approach to existing energy planning models which do not consider geographical characteristics related to energy and aims to provide invaluable support to policy and decision makers on least-cost electrification strategies.

The tool was initially applied to Nigeria, Ethiopia and India, featuring in the World Energy Outlook 2014 and 2015 and the World Bank Global Tracking Framework 2015. ONSSET has recently been applied to 44 Sub-Saharan African countries and  10 Latin American countries. This effort forms the basis of United Nations suite of tools to promote capacity development for achieving aspects of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7), such as access to affordable supplies of modern sustainable energy for all.

# Online interfaces

The online interface is part of the modelling tools for sustainable development and based on ONSSET. 
This interface is not a model but it provides the user easy access to the methodology behind ONSSET, the datasets used and key results -with regards to electrification planning - obtained for a set of predefined scenarios and model runs for developing countries in SSA and Latin America.
