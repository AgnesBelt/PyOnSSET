# OnSSET

KTH-dESA researchers are developing an innovative Open Source Spatial Electrification Toolkit. **OnSSET** is  a bottom up optimization energy modelling tool, that estimates, analyzes and visualizes the most cost effective electrification option (grid, mini grid & stand-alone) for the achievement of electricity access goals. To do so, **OnSSET** takes into account spatially explicit characteristics related to energy. Such data include population density and distribution, proximity to transmission and road network, nighttime lights, local renewable energy potential etc.

**OnSSET** focuses on the assessment and deployment of conventional and renewable energy technologies aiming at ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. It is a complementary approach to existing energy planning models which do not consider geographical characteristics related to energy and aims to provide invaluable support to policy and decision makers on least-cost electrification strategies.

The tool was initially applied to Nigeria, Ethiopia and India, featuring in the World Energy Outlook 2014 and 2015 and the Global Tracking Framework 2015. **OnSSET** has recently been applied to 44 Sub-Saharan African countries and  10 Latin American countries. This effort forms the basis of United Nations suite of tools to promote capacity development for achieving aspects of [Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7)](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/energy/), such as access to affordable supplies of modern sustainable energy for all.

# PyOnSSET

Python implementation of the Open Source Spatial Electrification Toolkit (**OnSSET**).
See the Jupyter version here: [PyOnSSET-jupyter](https://github.com/KTH-dESA/PyOnSSET-jupyter)

# Online interfaces

The online interface [Universal Electrification Access](https://un-desa-modelling.github.io/electrification-paths-visualisation/) is part of the modelling tools for sustainable development and is based on **OnSSET**. 
This interface is not a model but it provides the user easy access to the methodology behind **OnSSET**, the datasets used and key results -with regards to electrification planning - obtained for a set of predefined scenarios and model runs for developing countries in SSA and Latin America.
